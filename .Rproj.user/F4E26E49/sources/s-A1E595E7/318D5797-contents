### Reading notes

FEDAI Chapter 2 pp. 22-30


#### Notation

Some notation going forward: 

$i$ refers to subects 1 through $N$. 

$d_i$ indicates if the *i*th subject is treated. ($d_i = 1$ is treated, $d_i = 0$ is not)

$Y_i(1)$ is the potential outcome if the *i*th subject were treated, and $Y_i(0)$ the potential outcome if not treated. 


**The Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** is defined as the sum of $\tau_i$ (all subject level treatment effects) divided by the sum of the number of subjects: 

$$
ATE = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \tau_i = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i(1)-Y_i(0))
$$
